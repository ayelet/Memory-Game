# Memory-Game
![screenShot](https://github.com/ayelet/Memory-Game/blob/main/img/MyMemoryCardGame.JPG)
This is a memory card game.
Initial state is a 3x4 card layout, but difficulty can be changed by the user.

It was a really fun project, altough I had some issues with my attempts of encapsulating the entities in the app.
