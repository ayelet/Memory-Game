# Memory-Game

This is a memory card game.
Initial state is a 3x4 card layout, but difficulty can be changed by the user.

It was a really fun project, altough I had some issues with my attempts of encapsulating the entities in the app.

This is a class diagram that depicts the relations between entities in the design.
